Add a new file to the arithmetic package and paste the following code in the file:

package mymath
func Factorial(n int) int {
    var f int = 1
    for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
        f *= i
    }
    return f
}
Execute the application from Exercise #1 again.

Notice what's happening when you execute the application and if there is any error, solve it!
